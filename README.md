# Using Pubmed data and tf.keras to predict if an ophthalmology paper will make it into a top 15 journal
For this tutorial, I show how to write a simple algorithm to predict if a paper, based solely on its abstract and title, is one published in one of the ophthalmology field's top 15 journals (as gauged by Google Scholar on the basis of h-index from 2014-2018). It will be trained and tested on a dataset comprising every English-language ophthalmology-related article with an abstract in Pubmed (the free search engine operated by NIH covering practically all life sciences-related papers) published from 2010 to 2019. 
It will also incorporate a number of different functionality (e.g., multiple input models using tf.keras and tf.data, using the same embedding layer on multiple input sequences, using padded batches with tf.data to incorporate sequence data) that I've seen fewer tutorials online but which I've used on multiple projects. This piece also assumes you know the basics of Python 3 (and Numpy) and have installed Tensorflow 2 (with GPU support), BeautifulSoup, lxml, and Tensorflow Datasets.
